# WeatherPT
Weather app from Code.Org that functions with a database.
This code may not work straight from the file, as the database needs to be connected. Attatched with this file is a sample database of what this program worked with in Code.Org.
This program allows the user to find the weather for any area, based on simple dropdowns and simple information not being overwhelmed by popups and information they don't understand.
This program can be useful to offer an alternative and an easy way to check for weather in all US states and some cities.
